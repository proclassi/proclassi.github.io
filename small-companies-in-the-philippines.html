Camille Jazul-Salita, 28, beauty adviser in Qatar Airways, is one those Filipino overseas who came home. She was planning to resign in August but she did it earlier because of the COVID. Jazul Salita quips that she plans to enroll in a baking class at a state-owned technical school while she is here in the Philippines (Tadalan, 2020).
In today's difficult times, planning is essential to the success of any business. When a company bus plan to follow, it is ready to face the future. As Book of Luke chapter 14 verse 28 says “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?"
 If you were Jazul-Salita, are you going to open a small business amidst this crisis? How will you manage the cost of your small venture?</a>

                                            space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers. Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city. The phase out doesn't mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there. Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules sot they don't have to clog loading/ unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn't have to wait long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience. Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips. Use the Pasig River. They Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road.

But suddenly, as the pandemic arose, he is one of the many employees who were affected and not able to renew his contract. With only P50,000, he went home. Months passed, everybody is still locked down. Mr. and Mrs. Ongkiko are already worrying on how their family will survive the crisis. Until one day, Roberto thought of a plan of repairing appliances in their neighborhood. At first, nobody believed in him other than his wife. But they never gave up. His wife posted online about the new venture and works from before of his husband, while their children shared it in social media. After several days, costumers are now approaching. His works are so good and efficient that he is being recommended to other people. And with the small capital he had, he put up his own electrical shop and started buying electrical materials, tools and supplies to be sold in their shop and online. He even researches on how to improve their new business. There are good days, there are also not so good times. But he promised his family that he will continue to strive.

                                            Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney (an excerpt)
Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phaseout. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
 But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic
rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve the traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule. 
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to
be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the drivers earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes-is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and medicare premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in many cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along a narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up
only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepneys is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation
during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading/unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and busses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait for long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metroten by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high
tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

                                            Note: Score has to be multiplied by 2. The same rubric will be applied in the reflection. Reflection Have you remembered Ms. Gina Lopez, who has been our late DENR Secretary for just a short period of time? From June 30, 2016 to May 3, 2017, Ms. Gina showed enthusiasm in her job whom wasted no time in addressing environmental issues. She was an empowered environmental activist since then. Now, let us look unto one of the scenarios that she is concerned with and that was eventually able to pursue closure of some mining companies. If you happen to explore Caraga region, you can affirm its richness in minerals because of several small- and large-scale mining companies that are currently operating. The existence of such companies undeniably threatens the environment and even human health. There was a study conducted on the aquatic biodiversity of Lake Mainit, Southern Philippines. Results showed a decline in fish resources as compared to a previous study. The researchers believed for several reasons why there was a difference on the species composition overtime. One of those reasons is the degrading water quality because of mining and domestic activities (Uy et al., 2015). With regards to water quality, Ebol et al. (2020) evaluated the levels of heavy metals namely Cadmium, Lead, and Mercury from key aquatic fauna and sediments. They also believed that the lake is at risk from such contamination due to industrial, agricultural wastes, and mining endeavors. Basically, mine discharges pollute water streams leading to the lake and other bodies of water that thereby accumulates toxins over time which greatly affect the land and water ecosystem. Lake Mainit plays important role in the lives of people nearby. It brought abundance and diverse offerings to humans, serving as a source of their living and a source of products within and outside the region. The irresponsible activities today would surely affect tomorrow's lives. With Ms. Gina's utmost concern, she was strongly firm in dealing the issue right away. If the same situation will continue in which the mining operates without taking serious considerations to the local environment and residents, what do you think will be a great impact towards the young generations like you in the near future? Express your reflection in five to ten sentences. .​</a>

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)

This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats are small. Hongkong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city. The phase out doesn't mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there. Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules sot they don't have to clog loading/ unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company.

While it is true that jeepneys take up more road space and consume more fuel for the number of passengers they can accommodate, they still serve a vital role in providing transportation in areas with limited options. Instead of completely phasing out jeepneys, a more practical solution would be to regulate their routes and ensure they are only used in areas where they are most needed. Additionally, efforts could be made to modernize jeepneys to make them more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly.</p><br />

He has a family in the Philippines, a wife and three children. Their life is simple with only him working. But suddenly, as the pandemic arose, he is one of the many employees who were affected and not able to renew his contract. With only P50,000, he went home. Months passed, everybody is still locked down. Mr. and Mrs. Ongkiko are already worrying on how their family will survive the crisis. Until one day, Roberto thought of a plan of repairing appliances in their neighborhood. At first, nobody believed in him other than his wife. But they never gave up. His wife posted online about the new venture and works from before of his husband, while their children shared it in social media. After several days, costumers are now approaching. His works are so good and efficient that he is being recommended to other people. And with the small capital he had, he put up his own electrical shop and started buying electrical materials, tools and supplies to be sold in their shop and online. He even researches on how to improve their new business. There are good days, there are also not so good times. But he promised his family that he will continue to strive. He hopes that one day, after all that has happened in their lives, he looks forward to make his shop bigger and better, and become an inspiration to other people. Guide  Questions: 1. How does the pandemic affect the family of Roberto? 2. Was he able to solve his problem? How? 3. What are the qualities he has to achieve his own business? (Give at least 3) 4.

                            11. Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney (an excerpt)
Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phaseout. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
 But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic
rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve the traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule. 
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to
be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the drivers earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes-is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and medicare premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in many cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along a narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up
only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepneys is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation
during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading/unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and busses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait for long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metroten by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high
tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
