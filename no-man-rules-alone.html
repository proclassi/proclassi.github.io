Text 1.___________ Tungkung Langit and Alunsina
Origin: Visayas, Panay
Another creator and counterpart to the likes of Bathala and Kan-Laon, Tungkung
Langit created order out of chaos. He is industrious and loyal but despite his
efforts, his wife Alunsina, the virgin goddess from the east, accused him of having
an affair. They had a big fight, which caused Alunsina to run away. Tungkung
Langit did everything in his power to bring her back to no avail. He threw her
favorite comb into the sky to make the moon and her jewels became the stars.
However, Alunsina never came back and Tungkung Langit lived alone in the sky.
Every time it rains, it is said to be Tungkung Langit’s tears and that the thunder
is his voice, calling Alunsina back.
Text 2.__________ The Sultan Who Can’t Let Go Origin: Mindanao, Island of Sulu
Before the Spaniards landed in the Philippines, the island of Sulu was ruled over
by a Sultan named Barrabas. He was selfish and cruel. And like a neurotic beauty
queen, he was never seen in public without his crown. One day, Sultan Barrabas
was feasting on a massive banquet by himself when a beggar child appeared out
of nowhere and begged him for a bite to eat. At first, the sultan ignored the kid
and went back to gorging on his personal Spiral buffet. The child persisted in
begging for a bite, and even resorted to tugging at the sultan’s leg to get his
attention. In a fit of impatience, Sultan Barrabas grabbed a steaming bowl of soup
and dumped its contents over the child’s head. The beggar boy then abruptly
vanished, as the sultan collapsed to the floor. He died shortly after and was given
a funeral without much fanfare. Some months after a new sultan was crowned, a
tree took root on the previous ruler’s grave. On its branches hung fruits with
protrusions on the bottom that looked like tiny crowns, much like the one that
Sultan Barrabas never took off. It wasn’t long before people started calling the
small green orbs “barrabas” (which later evolved to bayabas), after the king whose
face and disposition was as sour as the fruits’ flesh.
Text 3. ___________ Huhud ni Aliguyon Origin: Luzon, Ifugao Province In a village
called Hannanga, a boy named Aliguyon was born. He was the son of the village's
leader, Amtalao, and his wife Dumulao. He was a brilliant and intelligent young man
who was always eager to learn and listen to the stories and teachings of his father.
Indeed, he learned many useful things. He knew how to do proper combat, and even
how to chant a few magic spells. Aliguyon showed promise and great leadership at an
early age, which earned the awe and amazement of his fellow villagers, even children.
During his teenage years, he decided to go into battle with his father's enemy,
Pangaiwan of the village of Daligdigan. However, his challenge was not personally
answered by Pangaiwan. Instead, he went face-to-face with Pangaiwan's fierce son,
Pumbakhayon. Pumbakhayon was just as skilled in the arts of war and magic as
Aliguyon. Upon battle, without hesitation, Aliguyon hurled a spear towards
Pumbakhayon. Without blinking an eye, Pumbakhayon moved to avoid the spear,
caught it, and then quickly tossed it back towards Aliguyon's way. In retaliation,
Aliguyon did the same. The two of them continued this battle for a long time, with
Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon just alternately throwing one spear towards each other
in the hopes of ending the life of the other.
In the three years of their non-stop fight, neither of them showed signs of weariness
and defeat, causing Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon to develop respect and admiration
for each other. With their realization came the end of their fight. Together, Aliguyon
and Pumbakhayon developed and drafted a peace treaty between the towns of
Hannanga and Daligdigan, which their people celebrated and readily agreed to.</a>

                                            With the rise and prominence of the Shri-Visayan Empire in the 6th to the 13th centuries, political dominance by conquests and wars took place. By the series of wars , the men population was depleted. In the course of time, the women folks by necessity in the scarcity of available men, had to take the place of the men in the battlefield so that they came to develop the high art of warfare to preserve their political state.
About seven hundred years ago, when Pangasinan was a kingdom, there lived a famous woman ruler in that dominion. Young, beautiful and well-educated, Princess Urduja was reputed to be a good warrior who had personally led her soldiers to the battlefields. Her retinue consisted of women skilled in arms, in riding horses and with well-built and well-developed bodies, prodigious strengh and masculine physique dubbed as Kinalakian or Kalakian or Amazon.
To the Pangasinan court many a suitor came, seeking for the hand of fair Urduja. The Princess said to them, “I will marry only the man who can defeat me. My husband must be braver , stronger, and wiser than myself.” As no one qualified to her demands, she remained unmarried all her life. For no one wished to be beaten by a woman. When her mother died, she became the ruler of Pangasinan region. Her bravery and skill were known far and near. She ruled her people well and wisely. Like the famous Amazons of old, Princess Urduja was not only intelligent, beautiful, and dominant, but also the very personification of kindness and virtue. One of her policies was to introduce the best of other countries adapted to her own. She was a woman who was interested in foreign affairs for the good of her own kingdom. She liked to hear the tales about India, the Pepper Country.An Arab traveller, Ibn Batuta, on his way to china, stopped at her kingdom. According to her custom, she invited the ship’s crew to a banquet. The Arab refused to go because he could not eat their food since they were “infidels”. The princess was offended and summoned him. He was surprised at what his eyes witnessed and his ears heard. For the Princess was robed in her richest and best, decked with precious stones and surrounded by brave and loyal men and women. She talked to the visitor in Arabian. This alone proved that she was a Moslem, knew her Koran, and therefore knew Arabic, she told him: “You, Priest, I have had you brought here by my guards because, of all of your ship’s company, you alone scorned my invitation. You told your Captain that we, people of Northern Luzon are infidels, and that it would be against the prophets law for you, a holy man, to eat our food.”
“You behold about me, seated around my throne, the elderly ladies who are my counselors. Do their chairs of sandal-wood, does my silk canopied and gold plated throne, suggest the court of a barbarous people?”
“I greeted you with the usual salutations of courtesy in the Turkish tongue, and had one of my attendants fetch ink and paper so I could write for you in Arabic characters that you recognized as the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Are such tokens of culture common among barbarians?”
When my father Dalisay, the aged king by whose name you call his kingdom, was a much younger man, there visited here a priest of another faith from far distant Europe. But he did not shun novelty in food as you do. The sago trees that produce flour, interest him, he admired the sugar-giving buri palms, and liked our coconut wine. And I hope you will appreciate the cordial pickles and preserves which, with some other gifts for your acceptance in remembrance of the land of Dalisay, I have had sent to your ship.”

                                            Activity 2-B Directions: Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea. 1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life. 2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development. 3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it, was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of social experimentation that was occurring through much of the industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn, had significant influence on other countries as well. 4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who becomes late – Filipino or not. 5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system. His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his being.​</a>

                                            Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea.
1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have
beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round
it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life.
2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and
to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand
gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in
search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands
literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something
to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development.
3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform
efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the
United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it,
was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of
social experimentation that was occurring through much of the
industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the
social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn,
had significant influence on other countries as well.
4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices
early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to
the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting
ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does
not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who
becomes late – Filipino or not.
5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and
speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system.
His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for
communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social
dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his
being.</a>

Text 1.___________ Tungkung Langit and Alunsina
Origin: Visayas, Panay
Another creator and counterpart to the likes of Bathala and Kan-Laon, Tungkung
Langit created order out of chaos. He is industrious and loyal but despite his
efforts, his wife Alunsina, the virgin goddess from the east, accused him of having
an affair. They had a big fight, which caused Alunsina to run away. Tungkung
Langit did everything in his power to bring her back to no avail. He threw her
favorite comb into the sky to make the moon and her jewels became the stars.
However, Alunsina never came back and Tungkung Langit lived alone in the sky.
Every time it rains, it is said to be Tungkung Langit’s tears and that the thunder
is his voice, calling Alunsina back.
Text 2.__________ The Sultan Who Can’t Let Go Origin: Mindanao, Island of Sulu
Before the Spaniards landed in the Philippines, the island of Sulu was ruled over
by a Sultan named Barrabas. He was selfish and cruel. And like a neurotic beauty
queen, he was never seen in public without his crown. One day, Sultan Barrabas
was feasting on a massive banquet by himself when a beggar child appeared out
of nowhere and begged him for a bite to eat. At first, the sultan ignored the kid
and went back to gorging on his personal Spiral buffet. The child persisted in
begging for a bite, and even resorted to tugging at the sultan’s leg to get his
attention. In a fit of impatience, Sultan Barrabas grabbed a steaming bowl of soup
and dumped its contents over the child’s head. The beggar boy then abruptly
vanished, as the sultan collapsed to the floor. He died shortly after and was given
a funeral without much fanfare. Some months after a new sultan was crowned, a
tree took root on the previous ruler’s grave. On its branches hung fruits with
protrusions on the bottom that looked like tiny crowns, much like the one that
Sultan Barrabas never took off. It wasn’t long before people started calling the
small green orbs “barrabas” (which later evolved to bayabas), after the king whose
face and disposition was as sour as the fruits’ flesh.
Text 3. ___________ Huhud ni Aliguyon Origin: Luzon, Ifugao Province In a village
called Hannanga, a boy named Aliguyon was born. He was the son of the village's
leader, Amtalao, and his wife Dumulao. He was a brilliant and intelligent young man
who was always eager to learn and listen to the stories and teachings of his father.
Indeed, he learned many useful things. He knew how to do proper combat, and even
how to chant a few magic spells. Aliguyon showed promise and great leadership at an
early age, which earned the awe and amazement of his fellow villagers, even children.
During his teenage years, he decided to go into battle with his father's enemy,
Pangaiwan of the village of Daligdigan. However, his challenge was not personally
answered by Pangaiwan. Instead, he went face-to-face with Pangaiwan's fierce son,
Pumbakhayon. Pumbakhayon was just as skilled in the arts of war and magic as
Aliguyon. Upon battle, without hesitation, Aliguyon hurled a spear towards
Pumbakhayon. Without blinking an eye, Pumbakhayon moved to avoid the spear,
caught it, and then quickly tossed it back towards Aliguyon's way. In retaliation,
Aliguyon did the same. The two of them continued this battle for a long time, with
Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon just alternately throwing one spear towards each other
in the hopes of ending the life of the other.
In the three years of their non-stop fight, neither of them showed signs of weariness
and defeat, causing Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon to develop respect and admiration
for each other. With their realization came the end of their fight. Together, Aliguyon
and Pumbakhayon developed and drafted a peace treaty between the towns of
Hannanga and Daligdigan, which their people celebrated and readily agreed to.</h2><br />

By the series of wars , the men population was depleted. In the course of time, the women folks by necessity in the scarcity of available men, had to take the place of the men in the battlefield so that they came to develop the high art of warfare to preserve their political state.
About seven hundred years ago, when Pangasinan was a kingdom, there lived a famous woman ruler in that dominion. Young, beautiful and well-educated, Princess Urduja was reputed to be a good warrior who had personally led her soldiers to the battlefields. Her retinue consisted of women skilled in arms, in riding horses and with well-built and well-developed bodies, prodigious strengh and masculine physique dubbed as Kinalakian or Kalakian or Amazon.
To the Pangasinan court many a suitor came, seeking for the hand of fair Urduja. The Princess said to them, “I will marry only the man who can defeat me. My husband must be braver , stronger, and wiser than myself.” As no one qualified to her demands, she remained unmarried all her life. For no one wished to be beaten by a woman. When her mother died, she became the ruler of Pangasinan region. Her bravery and skill were known far and near. She ruled her people well and wisely. Like the famous Amazons of old, Princess Urduja was not only intelligent, beautiful, and dominant, but also the very personification of kindness and virtue. One of her policies was to introduce the best of other countries adapted to her own. She was a woman who was interested in foreign affairs for the good of her own kingdom. She liked to hear the tales about India, the Pepper Country.An Arab traveller, Ibn Batuta, on his way to china, stopped at her kingdom. According to her custom, she invited the ship’s crew to a banquet. The Arab refused to go because he could not eat their food since they were “infidels”. The princess was offended and summoned him. He was surprised at what his eyes witnessed and his ears heard. For the Princess was robed in her richest and best, decked with precious stones and surrounded by brave and loyal men and women. She talked to the visitor in Arabian. This alone proved that she was a Moslem, knew her Koran, and therefore knew Arabic, she told him: “You, Priest, I have had you brought here by my guards because, of all of your ship’s company, you alone scorned my invitation. You told your Captain that we, people of Northern Luzon are infidels, and that it would be against the prophets law for you, a holy man, to eat our food.”
“You behold about me, seated around my throne, the elderly ladies who are my counselors. Do their chairs of sandal-wood, does my silk canopied and gold plated throne, suggest the court of a barbarous people?”
“I greeted you with the usual salutations of courtesy in the Turkish tongue, and had one of my attendants fetch ink and paper so I could write for you in Arabic characters that you recognized as the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Are such tokens of culture common among barbarians?”
When my father Dalisay, the aged king by whose name you call his kingdom, was a much younger man, there visited here a priest of another faith from far distant Europe. But he did not shun novelty in food as you do. The sago trees that produce flour, interest him, he admired the sugar-giving buri palms, and liked our coconut wine. And I hope you will appreciate the cordial pickles and preserves which, with some other gifts for your acceptance in remembrance of the land of Dalisay, I have had sent to your ship.”

                            16. Activity 2-B Directions: Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea. 1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life. 2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development. 3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it, was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of social experimentation that was occurring through much of the industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn, had significant influence on other countries as well. 4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who becomes late – Filipino or not. 5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system. His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his being.​</h2><br />
