Write A if it is considered as advantages and D if it is Disadvantages.LET US REMEMBERInfrared Radiation lies beyond the red end of the visible light. It is emitted by all objects. The amount and wavelength of radiation depend on temperature. Below 500oC, an object emits only infrared radiation. Above 500oC, an object glows and emits both infrared and some visible light.Some useful applications of Infrared Radiation are Infrared photographs, scanners, remote controls, night-vision and etc.________1. Transmitters and receivers should be directly aligned to connect and communicate.________2. Higher security than radio waves since it requires “line of sight” transmission.________3. Weather sensitive; transmission can easily be affected by weather conditions like rains.________4. Lower power requirements that makes it ideal for laptops, and other technological devices.________5. Distance sensitive; performance drops as distance increases​</a>

Work desks should be strong enough to supportcomputers and equipment.4.) Heating and ventilation should be suitable for theworking environment.5.) Electrical sockets should not be overloaded.6.) Being prepared for emergencies means making sure that the necessary equipment andsupplies are readily available and that employees know what to do when somethingunplanned happens such as a release, spill, fire, or injury.7.) Elimination of a specific hazard or hazardous work process, or preventing it from enteringthe workplace, is the most effective method of control.8.) Food and drink should not be placed near a machine. .9.) It is important to monitor both the hazard and the control method to make sure that the controlis working effectively and that exposure to the hazard is reduced or eliminated.10.) Personal protective equipment should be the last choice in control measures.11.) The goal of controlling hazards is to expose workers to occupational hazards.12.) The right lighting can give you eyestrain, neck strain, and headaches.13.) Occupational hazards cannot be controlled by a variety of methods.14.) Electrical equipment should be tested every 2 years.15.) The most effective control measure is to control hazards at the source by eliminating thehazard or by substituting a hazardous chemical, machine, work process, etc., with a lessdangerous one.​</a>

Write A if it is considered as advantages and D if it is Disadvantages.LET US REMEMBERInfrared Radiation lies beyond the red end of the visible light. It is emitted by all objects. The amount and wavelength of radiation depend on temperature. Below 500oC, an object emits only infrared radiation. Above 500oC, an object glows and emits both infrared and some visible light.Some useful applications of Infrared Radiation are Infrared photographs, scanners, remote controls, night-vision and etc.________1. Transmitters and receivers should be directly aligned to connect and communicate.________2. Higher security than radio waves since it requires “line of sight” transmission.________3. Weather sensitive; transmission can easily be affected by weather conditions like rains.________4. Lower power requirements that makes it ideal for laptops, and other technological devices.________5. Distance sensitive; performance drops as distance increases​</h2><br />

Which pair of EM waves is commonly used for communication?</strong></p><p></p> Radio waves and microwaves - These electromagnetic waves are commonly used for communication. Radio wave transmit signal to the radio and television and the signal is converted into mechanical vibrations in speakers, it is the sound you're hearing. Antennae in TV receives radio waves and broadcast the images on the screen of the television. Microwaves are used to send signals to earth from satellites, and vice versa. Mobile phones also uses microwaves to send signals -- it will reflect off metal surfaces and walls to communicate with the nearest device with transmitter mast.<p></p><p><strong>2. Radio wave is useful in which of the following applications?</strong></p><p></p> Radio wave is useful in watching TV. The radio waves transmit the signal to the antennae of the TV and will broadcast the image and sound to its screen and speaker, respectively.<p></p><p><strong>3. All of the following made use of gamma rays except one. Which is it?</strong></p><p></p>Gamma ray is used to treat tumors and other cancer cells, it is also used for medical sterilization and food sterilization. Some are using gamma rays to treat water, specially in treatment of wastewater. For water sterilization in drinking fountain is UV rays are used.<p></p><p><strong>4. Infrared waves is useful in which of the following applications?</strong></p><p></p> Remote control (Infrared Remote or Transmitter Device) uses infrared light to carry or transmit signals from the remote to the device it controls, usually a TV. It emits a light pulses of invisible infrared wave that correspond to specific binary codes. If you noticed IR remotes won't work through walls, around corners, or if you're covering the transmitter itself.<p></p><p><strong>5. Microwave is useful in which of the following applications?</strong></p><p></p>Cellphone communication is one of the useful application of microwave. Please refer to number one.<p></p><p><strong>6. In visible light, which color has the longest wavelength?</strong></p><p></p>The wavelengths of visible light are:<p></p><p>Violet: 380–450 nm , Blue: 450–495 nm,  Green: 495–570 nm, Yellow: 570–590 nm, Orange: 590–620 nm, Red: 620–750 nm. As you observed, the color red has the longest wavelength among the colors in visible light.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. What form of wave makes your skin tan when exposed for a long period of time?</strong></p><p></p> UV light emitted by the sun makes your skin tan when it is exposed for a long period of time.<p></p><p><strong>8. Which of the following is not an application of visible light?</strong></p><p></p>Security markings is not an application of visible light because in can be seen by our naked eyes. These marking can only be seen under a UV light.<p></p><p><strong>9. Which of the following is the correct meaning of the acronym GPS?</strong></p><p></p> GPS means Global Positioning System, it is used for navigation (radio navigation system) to allow the accurate location or position of a device or a vehicle, the GPS also includes time data and velocity.<p></p><p><strong>10. Colors in the infrared image depend on?</strong></p><p></p> Temperature, difference in surface temperature creates images on the screen of device that captured infrared waves to form an image.<p></p><p><strong>11. Which of the devices below can be used to detect aircrafts and ships?</strong></p><p></p>RADAR or radio detection and ranging uses radio wave to transmit signal to reflect off a transmitter on an object (a ship or aircraft), and it will determine its exact location, range and velocity.<p></p><p><strong>12. What device uses thermal imaging technology to capture the light being emitted  as heat by objects in the field of view?</strong></p><p></p> Infrared camera uses thermal imaging technology to capture infrared light emitted by the object's surface because of the temperature difference.<p></p><p><strong>13. Which of the EM waves below is used to remove most forms of microbiological  contamination from water?</strong></p><p></p> UV light is used for the sterilization of water, removing most form of contaminants.<p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><p>Frequency of the electromagnetic waves​: brainly.ph/question/9107630</p><p></p><br />
