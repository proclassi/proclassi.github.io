This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</a>

This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</h2><br />
