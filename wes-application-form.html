MAIL MERGE a Mail Merge is a Microsoft feature that allows the user to create doc- uments and combine and merge them with another document or data file. It is most often used to print or email form letters and when sending out advertising materials to multiple recipients. Using Mail Merge, the user can easily customize form letters for individual recipients. Mail merge is also used to create envelopes or labels. Basically mail merging requires two components: the document that contains the message and the document or file that generally contains the list of names and addresses. The Form Document It is generally the document that contains the main body of the message we want to convey or send. In mail merging the main body of the message is the part of the document that remains the same no matter whom you send it from among your list.. It includes place holders, also referred to as data fields or merge fields. This where the individual data or information will be inserted. On a printed standard form, this will the underlined spaces that will see and use as guide to where you need to write the information that you need to fill out. In its simplest form, a form document is literally a form that needs to fill out with individual information, (e.g. Phil health form, tax form or any application form). The List or Data File This is where the individual information or data that needs to be plugged in (merged) to the form document is placed and maintained. The best feature of a mail merge is that it allows data file to be created within the Microsoft Word application and can get data from Microsoft Excel or other data application formats. Fields that needed to be filled up on the form document can easily be maintained without accidentally altering the form or main document. It can be easily modified, add, remove or extract data efficiently by using other data management applications like Excel access and import them in Word during the mail merge process.​</a>

                            5. Activity 4: Reading Activity Concepts Notes: Read and understand the ideas and concept being presented. MAIL MERGE a Mail Merge is a Microsoft feature that allows the user to create doc- uments and combine and merge them with another document or data file. It is most often used to print or email form letters and when sending out advertising materials to multiple recipients. Using Mail Merge, the user can easily customize form letters for individual recipients. Mail merge is also used to create envelopes or labels. Basically mail merging requires two components: the document that contains the message and the document or file that generally contains the list of names and addresses. The Form Document It is generally the document that contains the main body of the message we want to convey or send. In mail merging the main body of the message is the part of the document that remains the same no matter whom you send it from among your list.. It includes place holders, also referred to as data fields or merge fields. This where the individual data or information will be inserted. On a printed standard form, this will the underlined spaces that will see and use as guide to where you need to write the information that you need to fill out. In its simplest form, a form document is literally a form that needs to fill out with individual information, (e.g. Phil health form, tax form or any application form). The List or Data File This is where the individual information or data that needs to be plugged in (merged) to the form document is placed and maintained. The best feature of a mail merge is that it allows data file to be created within the Microsoft Word application and can get data from Microsoft Excel or other data application formats. Fields that needed to be filled up on the form document can easily be maintained without accidentally altering the form or main document. It can be easily modified, add, remove or extract data efficiently by using other data management applications like Excel access and import them in Word during the mail merge process.​</h2><br />
