Due to the restrictions placed on people's mobility, many businesses had to close, which resulted in individuals losing their jobs and income.</p><p></p><p>But because to one person standing up to inspire the bayanihan spirit in everyone, people have discovered a new way to strengthen themselves rather than falling into desperation. <strong>An entrepreneur and University of the Philippines alumna named Ana Patricia "Patreng" Non inspired the bayanihan spirit by setting up a small cart outside of her home in Maginhawa, Quezon City,</strong> where people could buy food and other items to get by for the day and share any extras that could be used by another family.</p><p></p><p>This <strong>straightforward act of sharing and giving has inspired farmers and other organizations to donate,</strong> and it has developed into the Maginhawa Community Pantry. Since then, people from all over the Philippines have started to establish community pantries in their neighborhoods, turning this modest act of kindness into a movement.</p><p></p><p>More than<strong> 200 hundred pantries had been established by May, and the campaign has inspired others to establish community pantries</strong> as far away as our neighbor, Timor Leste. The community pantry movement may have seen obstacles and criticism, but Patreng's efforts to inspire people to support their livelihoods by assisting one another are too admirable to fail.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Five choices for the type of product: </p>News ArticleChildren’s BookPosterModelDigital Presentation<p></p><p></p><p>News related articles:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18397118 </p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>For my Cultural Content Connections Project, I have chosen to write a news article about my community icon.</p><p></p><p>My community icon is Jane Goodall, a renowned primatologist and conservationist who has made significant contributions to the understanding of chimpanzee behavior and the conservation of primates and their habitats. Goodall was born in England and spent much of her childhood in Africa, where she developed a love for animals and a fascination with chimpanzees.</p><p></p><p>In the 1960s, Goodall began studying chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first person to observe and document the complex social and emotional lives of these primates. She made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the fact that chimpanzees use tools and have distinct cultures, and she helped to debunk the myth that only humans had the capacity for complex thought and emotion.</p><p></p><p>Goodall's work has had a profound impact on the scientific community and has helped to raise awareness about the importance of conservation and the need to protect endangered species. In addition to her scientific work, Goodall has also been a vocal advocate for environmental and animal rights issues, and she has founded several organizations dedicated to these causes.</p><p></p><p>As a resident of the community where Goodall conducted much of her research, I have personally benefited from her contributions to our understanding of the natural world and the need to protect it. Her work has inspired me to become more aware of environmental issues and to take action to protect the planet. I believe that her contributions have had a lasting impact on our community and culture, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn about and celebrate her work.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Emerging trends in education are increasingly moving towards learner-centered approaches. In these, learning becomes an active process of discovery and participation based on self-motivation rather than on more passive acquaintance of facts and rules (Sfard, 1998). The role of the teacher is coming more to be seen as mentor or guide, facilitating and playing an essential role in this process. From this perspective, learning can be considered as a dynamic process in which the learner actively "constructs" new knowledge as he or she is engaged and immersed in a learning activity (Papert, 1993). The theory of constructivism is at the core of the movement to shift the center of instruction away from delivery in order to allow the leamer to actively direct and choose a personal learning path. Jonassen (1998) claims that designers committed to designing and implementing constructivist learning environments need an appropriate set of design tools and methods which are consistent with the fundamental assumptions of those environments for analyzing learning outcomes and designing constructivist learning environments.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>CARRY </strong><strong>ON </strong><strong>LEARNING.</strong><br />
