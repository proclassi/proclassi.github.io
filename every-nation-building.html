                                            A wise government utilizes all the resources, energies, and interests of the country for the purpose of the nation. A wise government will, in every way, promote unity, association, cooperation, assimilation—not deeper separation. A wise government builds up, all through the nation, a sense of security, satisfaction, contentment, hope. That is what makes for civic morale, public spirit, loyalty. A wise government never fosters, directly or indirectly, envies, prejudices, hostilities. That way lies national destruction.

It jolted us to realize that gains made after spending so much planning, effort, cost and time could diminish considerably and quickly for reasons beyond one‘s anticipation; that it is much easier to destroy than to build; that in a crisis of national proportions that affects every aspect of human life, governments need to have the support and cooperation of the people if it is to succeed in battling the cause of that crisis, that there are people who ask for compassion but show none themselves; that life, after all, is fickle like the weather.​</a>

Thus, they build at an early age a reading readiness that develops into a readingaptitude. Others, unfortunately, never see a book around the house and become allergic to print! The tragicresults of this are millions of illiterate young men and women, who could not pass a simple reading test.Not only do we need good readers to make us a strong nation, but we also want every boy and girl to bepersonally successful in schoolwork and in his or her future occupation as an adult.Topic Sentence:______________Supporting Details: 1._________ 2.__________3.__________​</a>

                                            Our Country's Greatness A wise government utilizes all the resources, energies, and interests of the country for the purpose of the nation. A wise govemment will, in every way, promote unity, association, cooperation, assilation-not deeper separation. A wise government builds up, all through the nation, a sense of security, satisfaction, contentment, hope. That is what makes for the civic morale, public spirit, loyally.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Assimilation, in anthropology and sociology, the process whereby individuals or groups of differing ethnic heritage are absorbed into the dominant culture of a society. The process of assimilating involves taking on the traits of the dominant culture to such a degree that the assimilating group becomes socially indistinguishable from other members of the society. As such, assimilation is the most extreme form of acculturation. Although assimilation may be compelled through force or undertaken voluntarily, it is rare for a minority group to replace its previous cultural practices completely; religion, food preferences, proxemics (e.g., the physical distance between people in a given social situation), and aesthetics are among the characteristics that tend to be most resistant to change. Assimilation does not denote “racial” or biological fusion, though such fusion may occur.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
