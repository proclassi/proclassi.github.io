What happens when a Youtube star writes a book by Bong Osorio Since the dawn of the Web and its many versions, numerous Internet sensations have come and gone, but only a few have sustained and continue to increase their following. One of them is Felix Kjellberg, popularly known by his Internet alias "PewDiePie." He is a 20-something Swede who has lingered as YouTube’s biggest star since 2013, garnering over 40 million followers on his channel. This makes him the holder of the Guinness Book of World Records title for generating the most number of subscribers of all time. What’s more astounding about his fame is that his videos have been viewed over 10 billion times but he remains strange and nameless to most of his audience. PewDiePie is a social media phenomenon whose popularity emanates from his one-of-a-kind approach to his video productions, which usually start off with a shrill declaration of his name before he slides into mocking, panicky reactions to various games and activities. At the end, he thanks his "bros" for tuning in. PewDiePie’s fans have multiplied swiftly and become more pervasive because instant communication facilitates increased word of mouth. Following his social media success, PewDiePie ventured into book publishing and came up with This Book Loves You, now a New York Times bestseller that is poised to become an international sensation as well. The tome is an extremely imaginative pictorial collection of direction and advice manifested in gags and witticisms that lampoons Internet memes and passages. As he declared, it is a "parody on self-help books" and is "full of useful quotes." This Book Loves You serves up a lot of toilet humor and impassioned communication. The heftiest improprieties, though, are masked by intriguing visuals or cheeky figures, while still making the message</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Colloquial – Informal writing is similar to a spoken conversation.  Informal writing may include slang, figures of speech, broken syntax, asides and so on.  Informal writing takes a personal tone as if you were speaking directly to your audience (the reader). You can use the first or third person point of view (I and we), and you are likely to address the reader using second person (you and your).
</p><p>
</p><p>Simple – Short sentences are acceptable and sometimes essential to making a point in informal writing. There may be incomplete sentences or ellipsis(…) to make points.
</p><p>
</p><p>Contractions and Abbreviations – Words are likely to be simplified using contractions (for example, I’m, doesn’t, couldn’t, it’s) and abbreviations (e.g. TV, photos) whenever possible.
</p><p>
</p><p>Empathy and Emotion – The author can show empathy towards the reader regarding the complexity of a thought and help them through that complexity

What happens when a Youtube star writes a book by Bong Osorio Since the dawn of the Web and its many versions, numerous Internet sensations have come and gone, but only a few have sustained and continue to increase their following. One of them is Felix Kjellberg, popularly known by his Internet alias "PewDiePie." He is a 20-something Swede who has lingered as YouTube’s biggest star since 2013, garnering over 40 million followers on his channel. This makes him the holder of the Guinness Book of World Records title for generating the most number of subscribers of all time. What’s more astounding about his fame is that his videos have been viewed over 10 billion times but he remains strange and nameless to most of his audience. PewDiePie is a social media phenomenon whose popularity emanates from his one-of-a-kind approach to his video productions, which usually start off with a shrill declaration of his name before he slides into mocking, panicky reactions to various games and activities. At the end, he thanks his "bros" for tuning in. PewDiePie’s fans have multiplied swiftly and become more pervasive because instant communication facilitates increased word of mouth. Following his social media success, PewDiePie ventured into book publishing and came up with This Book Loves You, now a New York Times bestseller that is poised to become an international sensation as well. The tome is an extremely imaginative pictorial collection of direction and advice manifested in gags and witticisms that lampoons Internet memes and passages. As he declared, it is a "parody on self-help books" and is "full of useful quotes." This Book Loves You serves up a lot of toilet humor and impassioned communication. The heftiest improprieties, though, are masked by intriguing visuals or cheeky figures, while still making the message</h2><br />

                        <p>The adage <strong>the medium is the message</strong> is McLuhan's most well-known notion.</p><p>    The term "global village" has been used to convey the notion that people all over the world are connected through the usage of new media technologies (Marshall McLuhan, The Gutenberg Galaxy, 1962).</p>How the communities are entwined and interconnected as a result of the effect of so-called <strong>contemporary technology </strong>using the analogy of the nervous system of a human. in the same way that an optic nerve sends visual information from the eye to the brain. Everything is networked, much as electrical signals from the ear are sent to the auditory nerve, which then sends the signals to the brain. enough biological metaphors and jargon.The "global community" is now a reality thanks to <strong>globalization</strong>. By using the media's efforts, rather than waiting until 6 p.m. With TV Patrol News, we can access all the information we need via our cellphones, receiving news from every corner of the world. Communication has never been simpler.According to how some define <strong>"internet culture,</strong>" the global community with netizens as an identity has been developed on the internet. It accelerated globalization's dominance of the world as the internet continued to develop and advance. When you confiscated someone's phone, it was like taking away their freedom. The names "netizens," "internet culture," and "globalization" are not only contrived for the sake of using them; they are actually present in reality, as demonstrated by the concepts of these terms. In conclusion, exactly as McLuhan predicted in 1967, the "global village" is already a reality.<p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>Global communication: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/17543525</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><p></p><br />
