The researchers will strive hard to determine the clear outcome and demonstrate its significance to the people listed below:  Researchers.  This study allows the researchers to further expand our knowledge about the topic of group activity. In addition, the researchers are given the opportunity to explore their individual interests, acquire new knowledge, improve their capacity for problem-solving, and push themselves in new directions as a result of this study.     Students.  The findings of this research will be useful to students as they will gain a better understanding of the benefits and drawbacks associated with taking part in group activities. The findings of this study will also assist the students in becoming more motivated to participate in this.     Teachers.  As a result of this study, teachers will be in a better position to figure out which instructional strategies and activities are most effective for their students, including group activities, allowing them to achieve higher levels of academic success.  Principals and Administrators. The study's findings may provide an assessment of which teaching methods are beneficial or ineffective for students and teachers at the school. This may also encourage the Principal and Administrator to consider various activities such as group work to be often applied in order to make the learning process enjoyable for both students and teachers.    Parents.  This study will be helpful to parents as it will inform them about the effects that group activities have on their children. With this knowledge, parents will be able to guide their children through some of their activities and homeworks.     Future Researchers.  This research could serve as the study's anchor. The findings offered here will facilitate them in furthering their research. This study might potentially serve as a guide or reference for future researchers. They'll have an easier time because all they need to know about the topic has already been presented.- pa explaine nga po neto bigyan kopo kau maraming points plss need kopo bukas sa research namen! ​</a>
