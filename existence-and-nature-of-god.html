                        Rizal wrote, it can be said that his concept of God could be summarized into three (3) notions. First, he believed that God existed.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Aquinas thought eternal law to be that rational plan by which all creation is ordered, and natural law is the way that human beings participate in the eternal law.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.God is the Uncaused Cause:</p><p>•Since those laws govern time and space, time and space itself must have a cause that brought it into existence. Therefore, the cause of time and space, by necessity, must exist outside of time and space in order to be able to cause time and space into existence. That cause is God, who is the only uncaused cause.</p><p></p><p>2.Order in Nature:</p><p>•natural order is the moral source from which natural law seeks to derive its authority. Natural order encompasses the natural relations of beings to one another in the absence of law.</p><p></p><p>3.Nothing can explain its own existence:</p><p>•Nothing is a philosophical term for the general state of nonexistence, sometimes reified as a domain or dimension. </p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>"Hope Po Naka Tulong...</p><br />
