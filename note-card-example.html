note card and a clean jar. I put the jar over the beetle and slipped the note card under
it. Joel added his cicada and we got some damp grass and put it in the jar. For the
top, we fastened a piece of screen with a rubber band. Right after putting the insects in
the jar, we had fun watching and listening to our bugs. Tomorrow, we will put them
back outside. I’m planning to make a bug zoo of my own.

Explanation/Example</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Name calling is a propaganda technique where a person or a product is given a negative label in order to make it less attractive to the audience. This is often used in politics where candidates will call their opponents with negative names to discredit them. For example, in a political campaign, a candidate might refer to their opponent as a "liar" or a "cheater" to create a negative perception in the minds of the voters.</p><p></p><p>Card stacking is a propaganda technique where only positive information is presented while negative information is suppressed. Advertisements often use this technique to highlight only the positive features of their product while ignoring any negative aspects. For example, an advertisement for a car might highlight its fuel efficiency and performance but not mention its high price.</p><p></p><p>Soft soap is a propaganda technique where the audience is presented with information that is overly positive or flattering. Advertisements often use this technique to create a positive image of their product in the minds of consumers. For example, an advertisement for a beauty product might claim that it will make you look 10 years younger and give you flawless skin, even if the product has no scientific backing to support these claims.</p><p></p><p>Plain folks is a propaganda technique where the speaker presents themselves as a regular, down-to-earth person, just like the audience they are trying to appeal to. This technique is often used in political campaigns where candidates try to connect with voters by presenting themselves as an "ordinary person." For example, a politician might wear jeans and a t-shirt while giving a speech to appear relatable to their audience.</p><p></p><p>Glittering generalities is a propaganda technique where vague, positive-sounding statements are used to appeal to the emotions of the audience without providing any concrete information. Advertisements often use this technique to make their product sound appealing without actually providing any real benefits. For example, an advertisement for a soft drink might claim that it is "refreshing" and "energizing" without providing any actual information about what is in the drink.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainleists na din </p><br />

June 29, 2016
Today, in Science, we made a little bug zoo. We went for a nature walk, and I
found a beetle while Joel found a cicada. Anna ran back to the classroom and got a
note card and a clean jar. I put the jar over the beetle and slipped the note card under
it. Joel added his cicada and we got some damp grass and put it in the jar. For the
top, we fastened a piece of screen with a rubber band. Right after putting the insects in
the jar, we had fun watching and listening to our bugs. Tomorrow, we will put them
back outside. I’m planning to make a bug zoo of my own.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a sense, debit cards work as a cross between ATM cards and credit cards. You can use them to get cash from a bank's automated teller machine, as with the former; or you can make purchases with them, like the latter. In fact, many financial institutions are replacing their plain vanilla, single-purpose ATM cards with debit cards that are issued by major card-payment processors such as Visa or Mastercard. Such debit cards come automatically with your checking account.</p><p></p><p>Whether being used to obtain cash or to buy something, the debit card functions in the same way: It draws the funds immediately from the affiliated account. So, your spending is limited to what’s available in your checking account, and the exact amount of money you have to spend will fluctuate from day to day, along with your account balance.</p><p></p><br />
