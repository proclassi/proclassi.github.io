                        <p>DIARY OF QUEER WOMAN DURING PANDEMIC</p><p></p><p>         For the first few days when the lockdown started, I didn’t know what to do. I was at home and didn’t have any work to do because I had resigned from my job.</p><p></p><p>I started ruminating on my former days as an engineering student. My hostel life was very hard and full of unhappy events. I locked myself in my room, because being a lesbian ten years ago was uncommon, in India. I was in a small town where people were extremely homophobic.</p><p></p><p>I came out about three years back. My family and friends know about my identity, and thankfully they have accepted me. But for almost 25 years, I had struggled with my identity. During the stay at home order, all of it came back, the anxiety and the trauma, and I had no strategy to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>I discussed my feelings with a friend. Thankfully, I’m in a very safe space during the lockdown, but I know there are people who are stuck with homophobic parents, roommates, and landlords. My friend and I thought, “Let us start a virtual support group.”</p><p></p><p>So we started “Queer Adda.” ‘Adda’ means an informal conversation between friends, in Assamese. We held our first online support meeting a few weeks ago. It was really exciting. We had around 13 people, and four of them came out for the first time in front of a larger group.</p><p></p><p>After a session is over, people text things like, “You don’t know what you have done for me. For the first time, I am so happy and confident.” Some of them have said, “I understand now why I’m here, how I can shape myself.” All of this has made me feel happy too. We are sharing stories and struggles, and it helps me deal with my own trauma.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Let's call the distance between A and B "d".</p><p></p><p>When the car moves from A to B, it travels at an unknown speed, which we'll call "v1".</p><p></p><p>When the car moves from B to A, it travels at two different speeds - 50 km/hr and 30 km/hr. We can calculate the average speed for this portion of the journey using the formula for the average of two speeds:</p><p></p><p>average speed = (2 x speed1 x speed2) / (speed1 + speed2)</p><p></p><p>where speed1 and speed2 are the two speeds that the car travels at.</p><p></p><p>So the average speed of the car from B to A can be calculated as:</p><p></p><p>average speed = (2 x 50 km/hr x 30 km/hr) / (50 km/hr + 30 km/hr)</p><p>average speed = 3000 / 80</p><p>average speed = 37.5 km/hr</p><p></p><p>The total time taken for the journey is the sum of the time taken to travel from A to B and the time taken to travel from B to A.</p><p></p><p>Time taken to travel from A to B = d / v1</p><p></p><p>Time taken to travel from B to A = d / 37.5 km/hr</p><p></p><p>Total time taken = (d / v1) + (d / 37.5 km/hr)</p><p></p><p>The average speed of the car for the entire journey can be calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken:</p><p></p><p>Average speed = (2d) / [(d / v1) + (d / 37.5 km/hr)]</p><p></p><p>Simplifying this expression by taking the common factor of "d" in the denominator, we get:</p><p></p><p>Average speed = (2d / d) / [(1 / v1) + (1 / 37.5 km/hr)]</p><p></p><p>Average speed = 2 / [(1 / v1) + (1 / 37.5 km/hr)]</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the average speed of the car during the journey is given by the expression 2 / [(1 / v1) + (1 / 37.5 km/hr)], where "v1" is the speed of the car from A to B</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During pandemic we all know it's more challenging to maintain our health especially if we're forbidden to go out for excercise. To maintain our fitness and health, we can do other stuff or different kinds of excercises inside the house. These excercises are helpful such as planking, push ups, yoga, jumping rope, stretching and many more. All families can do these different types of excercises but we also need to eat a healthy diet, we must eat less meat and more vegies as well as fruits to keep our immune system strong.</p><br />

                            11. Why is it the St. Lorenzo ruiz and Pedro calungsod choose death over survival during the missionary journey?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pedro Calungsod (Spanish: Pedro Calúñgsod or archaically Pedro Calonsor; mid-1650s [3] – April 2, 1672), also known as Peter Calungsod and Pedro Calonsor, was a Catholic Filipino migrant, sacristan and missionary catechist who, along with the Spanish Jesuit missionary Diego Luis de San Vitores, suffered religious persecution and martyrdom in Guam for their missionary work in 1672.[4]
</p><p>
</p><p>While in Guam, Calungsod preached Christianity to the Chamorro people through catechesis, while baptizing infants, children, and adults at the risk and expense of being persecuted and eventually murdered. Through Calungsod and San Vitores's missionary efforts, many native Chamorros converted to Roman Catholicism.
</p><p>
</p><p>Calungsod was beatified on March 5, 2000, by Pope John Paul II, and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City on October 21, 2012.[5]</p><p><strong>hope its help</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                            12. short reflective essay about my math 9 journey during this pandemic class​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many things have changed as a result of COVID-19. Normally I would be at school on the weekdays expanding my mind, but with everything happening with COVID-19 my school and many others have been shut down for the remainder of the year. Instead of being in a classroom and learning, we are sent packets and given work online. You’re probably thinking "well at least you still get to learn,” and that may be true but not everyone has the resources to learn, or maybe we learn better in a classroom setting. School being closed is just one way COVID-19 has caused a lot of damage.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mathematics is a school subject that people have mixed feeling about. Many of my personal friends complain about math and express their dislike and hatred towards the subject. I, on the other hand, seem to enjoy math most of the time. Although I sometimes feel angry when I continue to get a certain problem incorrect, I always put my best effort into finding my mistake and fixing it. I have had some amazing math teachers, but I’ve also had some very bad ones. I think that my teacher has a huge effect upon how well I will learn that subject, which can be considered good or bad. I have always realized that math is a very important topic, so I have consistently worked very hard to learn it.</p><br />

It is becoming increasingly obvious that what worked in classrooms 20 years ago is no longer successful, or in some cases, practical. Students rely heavily on technology outside of school, yet while in school are stripped of their cell phones, iPods, and laptops. I have seen the removal of these items become the focus of school personnel, while I think the solution lies in how these items can further help students learn. I was working as a shadow in a kindergarten class at a time when all of the teachers were getting smart boards installed in their rooms. I had only been out of college for 5 years and had no idea how one functioned- I can only imagine how veteran teachers less technical than I felt! I witnessed firsthand how the technically advanced teachers were called into their coworker’s rooms for technical advice and instructions. I also got to see how the kindergarten teacher integrated the smart board into her daily routines. This piece of technology allowed them to interact with calendars, do math, and even observe eagles in a nest on a live webcam! There was nothing wrong with the way the students were learning prior to the smart board, but their learning was enhanced and brought to a higher quality with the help of this piece of technology. When I read about the various teacher preparation programs in the textbook, I was impressed and a little jealous. I wish my teacher preparation was as thorough as some of the examples! The text referred to teaching as a “sink or swim” profession, and that is so true! My two years of teaching were very isolated and frustrating. I did not have the support of a mentor and believe that having one would have made my time teaching less stressful and more beneficial to my students. It is my belief that more teacher prep programs should follow the footsteps of these programs.</strong></p><br />
