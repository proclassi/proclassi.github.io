It is an honor to die for one's country. Not everybody has that chance."- Jose Abad Santos Emotion: 2. "The obscenities of this country are not girls like you. It is the poverty which is obscene, and the criminal irresponsibility of the leaders who make this poverty a deadening reality. The obscenities in this country are the places of the rich, the new hotels made at the expense of the people, the hospitals where the poor die when they get sick because they don't have the money either for medicines or services. It is only in this light that the real definition of obscenity should be made."- F. Slonil José, Ermita A Filipino Novel Emotion: 3. "Sometimes it pays not to be interested in what happened but in what did not happen.'-Ambeth Ocampo, Rizal Without the Overcoat Emotion: 4. "Sometimes I can feel my bones straining under the weight of all the lives I'm not living."- Jonathan Safran Foer, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Emotion: 5.

The objective and subjective aspects of beauty are necessarily interdependent.3. For Plato, the realm of ideas (the forms) are less real than those things seen in the visible world.4. Truth is the right relation between our words and our thoughts.5. All the fundamental values, according to Dr. Adler, are trans-cultural.6. Wisdom is a special kind of truth, but it is not the same as truth.-7.
