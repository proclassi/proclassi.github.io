                                            The Legend of Dictionary
by: Ruel B. Diaz
A long time ago, people have no idea about words and their
meanings.
Dicson Nary, a migrant who loved traveling the world, saw a
small group of people talking with each other. He wondered what
they were talking about. His curiosity started then. He began
listening to others’ conversations, and day by day, new words were
being added on his list. He was very patient searching for new
words. He went to the different parts of the world looking for words
that can be added on his word list. He continued searching for
words. One day, he visited Merriam Webster, the most intelligent
man in the world to ask for help.
“I have listed words but how could this be used by the people
easily?’’, asked by Dicson. The two great men arrived into the idea
of listing words in a way the alphabet is ordered. Dicson never
stopped looking for words. He didn’t notice that the number of
words on his list are becoming more and more. People used to
visit his house for one reason. All of them asked the same
question, “Dicson what is the meaning of this word?” Days went
on, Dicson had become known in the world as a man of words.
In honor of his great work and passion for words, the book
that contains thousands of words and meanings was named after
him. It was called dictionary. “For him, words were already part of
human lives. You just have to discover its meaning by
understanding how they were being used by us. All of us can
make a dictionary. But not all can. Because patience had pushed
me going forward to do my passion I Am a WELL-DER (well-reader)

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>every reader had a lot of things that he/she discovered by reading that make them feel they had traveled and get involved in a situation that they've been discovered themselves, they felt the event,trails,discoveries, and experiences of the stories that they read,they were travelling the place that the character of thier stories does. and the most beautiful part of it you were be able to discover new things by simply reading a book of stories.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>same like people nowadays,but theyre not addicted by the most valuable stories but addicted with the K DRAMA...</p><br />

                            3. what can you say about the quotation of George R. Martin says that A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies... The man who never read lives only one.</h2><br />
                        All I can say about this quotation, as a book lover, is it is indeed true. When you got to read a new book, we tend to put the characters shoes on our own feet. We got to know their characteristics and the place they go to. As a reader I don’t just have a thousand lives but I also got to travel all parts of existing and non-existing places. Our imagination never stops. And as you felt those things, you will find it hard not to hold a book in the palm of your hands even just for a day. <br />

Direction: Put on the blank space the type of Text shown in each item.The world's biggest health crisis of our time is the rise of corona virus pandemic that not only threatens people but kill thousands of lives around the globe. It originates in Wuhan china last 2019 and is a highly contagious disease that easily spread around the world.1.

Type of Text:_____________ If oxygen is present in a wet material with iron, such as a nail or steel bar, the formation of rust occurs. It only happens when iron, oxygen, and water react with one another. Rust occurs when iron or alloys such as steel corrode, thus rusting is commonly known as iron or steel corrosion. 6. Type of Text:_____________Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two. 7.

Context clues are hints that a writer provides to help the readers get the meaning of a difficult or unusual word in a sentence. 9.

                            6. The Legend of Dictionary
by: Ruel B. Diaz
A long time ago, people have no idea about words and their
meanings.
Dicson Nary, a migrant who loved traveling the world, saw a
small group of people talking with each other. He wondered what
they were talking about. His curiosity started then. He began
listening to others’ conversations, and day by day, new words were
being added on his list. He was very patient searching for new
words. He went to the different parts of the world looking for words
that can be added on his word list. He continued searching for
words. One day, he visited Merriam Webster, the most intelligent
man in the world to ask for help.
“I have listed words but how could this be used by the people
easily?’’, asked by Dicson. The two great men arrived into the idea
of listing words in a way the alphabet is ordered. Dicson never
stopped looking for words. He didn’t notice that the number of
words on his list are becoming more and more. People used to
visit his house for one reason. All of them asked the same
question, “Dicson what is the meaning of this word?” Days went
on, Dicson had become known in the world as a man of words.
In honor of his great work and passion for words, the book
that contains thousands of words and meanings was named after
him. It was called dictionary. “For him, words were already part of
human lives. You just have to discover its meaning by
understanding how they were being used by us. All of us can
make a dictionary. But not all can. Because patience had pushed
me going forward to do my passion I Am a WELL-DER (well-reader)
