                                            Video Games Adversely Affect Children’s Brains By: Rafael Castillo
A lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP). Some parents even encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterity and could even improve their IQ. We now have robust scientific data indicating this impression to be erroneous
Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agility skills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory, attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.
Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studies that the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types of addiction.
A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictive substance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas like the prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to crave and go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being “addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.
Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which is the same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictive behavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,” unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledge and skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doing their school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

From the presented figure, it is seen that majority of the parents do have the strongest faith and hope in education. For they all consider education to be the best game changer in life. This should serve as an eye opener to all, especially to the youths, that education should be their priority, for this is the real avenue that will lead them to success.3. MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year. Duque warned that the risk of contracting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases when they mingle. with family members from other areas. He also encouraged the use of teleconferencing instead to meet other family members.4. You get to follow to what our good leader is telling you for he is a man of faith, words, and action. Those who refuse not to side with him will sure regret his/her ever biggest mistake of his/her life.5. Does our democracy is indeed a genuine one? Does it provide a fair and square opportunity to be heard? Does congress is really providing representation of the people from different places with different needs, interests, culture and faith? Do people beyond the poverty line are being provided the most needed attention not by the government alone but also by the entire stakeholders of the society? These questions are seeking the promptest answer from everyone. We should remember that we are all responsible to one another, as the saying states that no man is an island.6. Now, the darkest days and nights of our lives comes to an end as the most. reliable, most durable, most energy efficient, and unlike the leading brand, the brightest yet the cheapest LED LIGHT is now born.​​</a>

                                            Video Games Adversely Affect Children’s BrainsBy: Rafael CastilloA lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP).Some parents even  encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterityand  could  even  improve  their   IQ.   We   now   have   robust   scientific   data   indicating   thisimpression to be erroneous.Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agilityskills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory,attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studiesthat the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types ofaddiction.A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictivesubstance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas likethe prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to craveand go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being“addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which isthe same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictivebehavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,”unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledgeand skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doingtheir school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

I draw from an "ethnography of height" in the city of Puerto Princesa, Western Philippines to look at different domains in society where height "matters", including basketball games and beauty pageants that privilege tall bodies; jobs that explicitly or implicitly demand "height requirements"; public nutrition programs that use children's heights as an index of both individual and national well-being; and the everyday lives of the youths with whom I hung out. These materialities of height in the Philippines, I argue, make it valuable "asset" for young people, and makes explicable young people's aspirations of tallness. But although height emerges as a form of what I call "body capital", there is also a "becoming" in the aspiration of tallness (Biel and Locke, 2010), and therein, I argue, lies the efficacy of height-making practices. Moreover, the desire for tallness can be read as an idiom for young people's desire for better lives. Guide Questions: 1. What is the significance of the study to the following?

                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                            9. Video Games Adversely Affect Children’s Brains By: Rafael Castillo
A lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP). Some parents even encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterity and could even improve their IQ. We now have robust scientific data indicating this impression to be erroneous
Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agility skills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory, attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.
Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studies that the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types of addiction.
A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictive substance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas like the prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to crave and go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being “addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.
Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which is the same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictive behavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,” unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledge and skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doing their school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

CEBU CITY, Philippines - Local officials in Cebu City have reiterated their reminders to the public not to let their guard down just yet against the coronavirus. disease 2019 (COVID-19) now that December is just one sleep away. This as they discovered that most of the new confirmed cases of the infection has happened to be asymptomatic or infected individuals showing no symptoms of the disease.2. According to statistics, there is a 60.78% of the Filipino parents want their children to finish their studies, while 30.23% of them are saying that they just want their children to get a decent and permanent job someday, and the remaining 3.99\% are believing that skills will lead their children to a better day. From the presented figure, it is seen that majority of the parents do have the strongest faith and hope in education. For they all consider education to be the best game changer in life. This should serve as an eye opener to all, especially to the youths, that education should be their priority, for this is the real avenue that will lead them to success.3. MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year. Duque warned that the risk of contracting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases when they mingle. with family members from other areas. He also encouraged the use of teleconferencing instead to meet other family members.4. You get to follow to what our good leader is telling you for he is a man of faith, words, and action. Those who refuse not to side with him will sure regret his/her ever biggest mistake of his/her life.5. Does our democracy is indeed a genuine one? Does it provide a fair and square opportunity to be heard? Does congress is really providing representation of the people from different places with different needs, interests, culture and faith? Do people beyond the poverty line are being provided the most needed attention not by the government alone but also by the entire stakeholders of the society? These questions are seeking the promptest answer from everyone. We should remember that we are all responsible to one another, as the saying states that no man is an island.6. Now, the darkest days and nights of our lives comes to an end as the most. reliable, most durable, most energy efficient, and unlike the leading brand, the brightest yet the cheapest LED LIGHT is now born.​​</h2><br />

                            20. Video Games Adversely Affect Children’s BrainsBy: Rafael CastilloA lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP).Some parents even  encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterityand  could  even  improve  their   IQ.   We   now   have   robust   scientific   data   indicating   thisimpression to be erroneous.Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agilityskills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory,attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studiesthat the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types ofaddiction.A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictivesubstance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas likethe prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to craveand go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being“addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which isthe same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictivebehavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,”unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledgeand skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doingtheir school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

                            25. Directions: Given research titles and their abstracts below and explain the importance of conducting the study to the different stakeholders. I WANT TO BE TALL SOMEDAY: Height Aspirations Among Young People in the Philippines When the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve in the Philippines, many children jump as high as they can, believing (with their parents) that it would make them grow taller. In my ethnography, I found many other practices that are believed to boost children's statures when they grow -up, from sleeping in the afternoon to taking popular growth supplements that are overtly marketed with claims that it can make children grow tall. HATCHE What aspirations are embedded in the desire for tallness that informs these practices? I draw from an "ethnography of height" in the city of Puerto Princesa, Western Philippines to look at different domains in society where height "matters", including basketball games and beauty pageants that privilege tall bodies; jobs that explicitly or implicitly demand "height requirements"; public nutrition programs that use children's heights as an index of both individual and national well-being; and the everyday lives of the youths with whom I hung out. These materialities of height in the Philippines, I argue, make it valuable "asset" for young people, and makes explicable young people's aspirations of tallness. But although height emerges as a form of what I call "body capital", there is also a "becoming" in the aspiration of tallness (Biel and Locke, 2010), and therein, I argue, lies the efficacy of height-making practices. Moreover, the desire for tallness can be read as an idiom for young people's desire for better lives. Guide Questions: 1. What is the significance of the study to the following?

                            26. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?
