In a country that has faced disease outbreaks, the sight of doctors and nurses aiding the sick is comforting to many. It came as a surprise when some people started to turn against frontline health workers shortly after the lockdown in mid-March. Reports of health workers being attacked became news, with many experiencing eviction, ridicule, and harassment. Despite public adulation for their heroic sacrifices, frontline health workers fear for their lives as the risk of stigmatization weighs almost as heavy as their exposure to the virus.​</p>

Mental Health in The Time of COVID-19 and Social Distancing
By Ryanne Co
As someone who comes from a family of worriers, I will be the first to 
tell you: this new pandemic nothing to be taken lightly. There’s constant 
worry, and now, as we live through the first leg of enhanced community 
quarantine, I can imagine that the struggle with anxiety could get worse. Dr. 
Ronald del Castillo, a doctor of psychology (PsyD) and a master of public 
health (MPH) from the University of the Philippines Manila, concurs.
He says: “For those of us who are already experiencing mental health 
problems before the outbreak, such as depression, bipolar or other mental 
disorders, the quarantine can aggravate an already tough situation. Now, 
muddle these with other circumstances, many of which are entrenched for us 
here in the country, such as poverty, unemployment or underemployment, 
isolation, poor transportation, limited health care access, or disingenuous 
politicians, then the psychological impact of the quarantine is all the more 
difficult.”
And true enough, stories have been surfacing online of people worried 
about having to be quarantined alone or with toxic family members or 
roommates. It’s difficult when the flow of our everyday lives is disrupted by 
something as serious as a pandemic. With this, Tatler Philippines has 
compiled a list of tips on how we can get through this quarantine together. 
It’s all about taking a step back, slowing things down, and getting used to a 
new routine that, like everything else, is temporary.</a>

In the Philippines, when the rich inmate gets sick, a primary check up with tmilitary medic will be given and when the results are in, a resident doctor from a knohospital will be provided - attention and care that a poor inmate can't have.4. Mrs. Vepinoza has been a health worker in their barangay for many years. One dashe learns that their team leader who is a good friend of hers has been replaced byvery young community health worker. Mrs. Vepinoza thinks to herself, "How can thyoung team leader help our barangay? I doubt if he will be very useful."5. Eric is your classmate since grade 7 and you have the image of him as a fish outwater that makes you dislike him. He was absent for weeks due to some illness anyour teacher asked you to help Eric in catching up with the lessons that he missed. Idisliked the idea but agreed anyway because you can't turn downyour teacher's me!!How did you do? Was it easy? It can be difficult, but you should not let tillprejudices influence the kind of person that you are. You should practice fairnessfavouring one group above the other. It is important to bear in mind NOT to loown prejudices cause or bring pain nor damage to the people around you.​</a>

Mental Health in The Time of COVID-19 and Social Distancing
By Ryanne Co
As someone who comes from a family of worriers, I will be the first to 
tell you: this new pandemic nothing to be taken lightly. There’s constant 
worry, and now, as we live through the first leg of enhanced community 
quarantine, I can imagine that the struggle with anxiety could get worse. Dr. 
Ronald del Castillo, a doctor of psychology (PsyD) and a master of public 
health (MPH) from the University of the Philippines Manila, concurs.
He says: “For those of us who are already experiencing mental health 
problems before the outbreak, such as depression, bipolar or other mental 
disorders, the quarantine can aggravate an already tough situation. Now, 
muddle these with other circumstances, many of which are entrenched for us 
here in the country, such as poverty, unemployment or underemployment, 
isolation, poor transportation, limited health care access, or disingenuous 
politicians, then the psychological impact of the quarantine is all the more 
difficult.”
And true enough, stories have been surfacing online of people worried 
about having to be quarantined alone or with toxic family members or 
roommates. It’s difficult when the flow of our everyday lives is disrupted by 
something as serious as a pandemic. With this, Tatler Philippines has 
compiled a list of tips on how we can get through this quarantine together. 
It’s all about taking a step back, slowing things down, and getting used to a 
new routine that, like everything else, is temporary.</a>

                                            Stop the Stigma
Philippine Daily Inquirer /04:07 AM April 08, 2020
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are literally putaing themselves in haum's way to protect the greater Filipino
population against COVID.19. And yet, in an alarming twist, an increasing number of them, instead of being accorded the hero's
treatment they deserve, are being subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence, mainly due to unfounded COVID-19 fears.
Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision,
said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the
driver's explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital frontliners.

Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision,
said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the
driver's explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital frontliners.
Days before this, a mob ganged up on and threw bleach all over the face of a frontliner on his way to report for duty at a
hospital in Tacurong City in Sultan Kudarat, while a medical technologist in Cagayan de Oro claimed that some public vehicles
declined to let her board.
Also last week in Cebu, two nurses were barred from entering the condominium where they were staying after they
identified themselves as murses. It has become a common experience shared by many of their colleagues across the country; health
workers have found themselves evicted from eateries in Iloilo, turned away from their dormitories in Baguio, refused transport by
tricycles in Cabanatuan City and Quezon City, and so on.
Patients, too, are targeted. In a barangay in Tondo, a resident who tested positive was blocked from retuming to his rented
apartmcar. The health department's order was for him to self-quarantine at home since he was asymptomatic, but the barangay's
residents barricaded the street and refused to let the ambulance through, despite a Manila councilor coming over to try to resolve
the impasse. The patient, unable to return home to his parents who were elderly and thus at high-risk of contracting the disease,
was forced to find temporary shelter in a hospital.
Sometimes, all it takes is wild suspicion, and anyone can become an object of hostility and rejection. As GMA News
reported last Monday "A supermarket security guard lost both her rented apartment and her job after she went home one day and
seemed to have been running a fever." When a thermal scan showed her temperature to be above 36 degrees Celsius, she was told
to go the hospital first and have herself checked. The hospital determined she had no fever, but when she got back to her apartment,

Bernadette)Similar to other countries, the public health system in the Philippines was unprepared forand overburdened by COVID-19. The first case was reported on January 30 when a Chinese womanreached the country from Wuhan, China, and then a few days later her male companion died ofthe virus - making it the first recorded death outside of China (Department of Health (DOH), 2020b;Ramzy and May, 2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a). By March 7, the first case oflocal transmission was confirmed (DOH, 2020a; WHO, 2020a). To date, there are 112,593confirmed cases, 6,263 new cases, and 2,115 deaths in the country (WHO, 2020b) - making the Philippines as one of the most highly impacted in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific RegionEqually alarming is the number of doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who get infected and die of COVID-19 (CNN Philippines, 2020a; McCarthy, 2020). Recently, professional medical and allied medical associations have called for a unified and calibrated response and temporaryquarantine of the country's capital to avoid a total collapse of the healthcare system (Batnag, 2020).Critical but seldom discussed are the challenges of journalism in making sense of the rapid spread and devastating impact of COVID-19 in the Philippines and how the pandemic is also gradually transforming journalism in the country.Questions: 1.

                                            PLEASE HELP ME TO ANSWER MY LEARNING TASK. THANKSWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Philippines in early March, people started looking for answers.In a country that has faced disease outbreaks, the sight of doctors and nurses aiding the sick is comforting to many. It came as a surprise when some people started to turn against frontline health workers shortly after the lockdown in mid-March.Reports of health workers being attacked became news, with many experiencing eviction, ridicule, and harassment. Despite public adulation for their heroic sacrifices, frontline health workers fear for their lives as the risk of stigmatization weighs almost as heavy as their exposure to the virus.It’s lonely in the front lineOne of the first to provide support as COVID-19 broke, UNICEF responded to requests from the Department of Health (DOH) and delivered tents to hospitals to help manage the triage and isolation of suspected cases and to increase the overall capacity for the response.At Sta. Ana Hospital in the capital Manila, one of the government-run hospitals that received a UNICEF tent, the medical staff say they’re fortunate because the management provides living quarters and meals.Being in the front line exposes them to immediate risks, so they’ve come to rely on each other.But when they find themselves alone at times, fear gets to them and hits the hardest during end of shift.“We face an internal struggle at the end of the day,” says Jose Karganilla, a 32-year-old nurse. “What if I get sick? I’m on my own.”His colleague and friend, Patrick Tan, 31, believes the pandemic makes some of them question why they do what they do. “Some of us struggle to accept that we’re risking our lives,” he says as he weighs his next words. “We’re working with one foot in the grave.”Sanita Uy-Vistal, a laboratory scientist, praises her colleagues in the front line. But she sometimes wishes they could get support, too.“People always see doctors and nurses. They don’t see the lab scientistbehind all this,” Sanita says. “We handle the specimen for testing which exposes us to a greater risk.”​</a>

Mental Health in The Time of COVID-19 and Social Distancing
By Ryanne Co
As someone who comes from a family of worriers, I will be the first to 
tell you: this new pandemic nothing to be taken lightly. There’s constant 
worry, and now, as we live through the first leg of enhanced community 
quarantine, I can imagine that the struggle with anxiety could get worse. Dr. 
Ronald del Castillo, a doctor of psychology (PsyD) and a master of public 
health (MPH) from the University of the Philippines Manila, concurs.
He says: “For those of us who are already experiencing mental health 
problems before the outbreak, such as depression, bipolar or other mental 
disorders, the quarantine can aggravate an already tough situation. Now, 
muddle these with other circumstances, many of which are entrenched for us 
here in the country, such as poverty, unemployment or underemployment, 
isolation, poor transportation, limited health care access, or disingenuous 
politicians, then the psychological impact of the quarantine is all the more 
difficult.”
And true enough, stories have been surfacing online of people worried 
about having to be quarantined alone or with toxic family members or 
roommates. It’s difficult when the flow of our everyday lives is disrupted by 
something as serious as a pandemic. With this, Tatler Philippines has 
compiled a list of tips on how we can get through this quarantine together. 
It’s all about taking a step back, slowing things down, and getting used to a 
new routine that, like everything else, is temporary.</h2><br />

In the Philippines, when the rich inmate gets sick, a primary check up with tmilitary medic will be given and when the results are in, a resident doctor from a knohospital will be provided - attention and care that a poor inmate can't have.4. Mrs. Vepinoza has been a health worker in their barangay for many years. One dashe learns that their team leader who is a good friend of hers has been replaced byvery young community health worker. Mrs. Vepinoza thinks to herself, "How can thyoung team leader help our barangay? I doubt if he will be very useful."5. Eric is your classmate since grade 7 and you have the image of him as a fish outwater that makes you dislike him. He was absent for weeks due to some illness anyour teacher asked you to help Eric in catching up with the lessons that he missed. Idisliked the idea but agreed anyway because you can't turn downyour teacher's me!!How did you do? Was it easy?

Mental Health in The Time of COVID-19 and Social Distancing
By Ryanne Co
As someone who comes from a family of worriers, I will be the first to 
tell you: this new pandemic nothing to be taken lightly. There’s constant 
worry, and now, as we live through the first leg of enhanced community 
quarantine, I can imagine that the struggle with anxiety could get worse. Dr. 
Ronald del Castillo, a doctor of psychology (PsyD) and a master of public 
health (MPH) from the University of the Philippines Manila, concurs.
He says: “For those of us who are already experiencing mental health 
problems before the outbreak, such as depression, bipolar or other mental 
disorders, the quarantine can aggravate an already tough situation. Now, 
muddle these with other circumstances, many of which are entrenched for us 
here in the country, such as poverty, unemployment or underemployment, 
isolation, poor transportation, limited health care access, or disingenuous 
politicians, then the psychological impact of the quarantine is all the more 
difficult.”
And true enough, stories have been surfacing online of people worried 
about having to be quarantined alone or with toxic family members or 
roommates. It’s difficult when the flow of our everyday lives is disrupted by 
something as serious as a pandemic. With this, Tatler Philippines has 
compiled a list of tips on how we can get through this quarantine together. 
It’s all about taking a step back, slowing things down, and getting used to a 
new routine that, like everything else, is temporary.</h2><br />

                            13. Stop the Stigma
Philippine Daily Inquirer /04:07 AM April 08, 2020
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are literally putaing themselves in haum's way to protect the greater Filipino
population against COVID.19. And yet, in an alarming twist, an increasing number of them, instead of being accorded the hero's
treatment they deserve, are being subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence, mainly due to unfounded COVID-19 fears.
Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision,
said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the
driver's explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital frontliners.
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are literally putting themselves in barm's way to protect the greater Filipino population
against COVID-19. And yet, in an alarming twist, an increasing number of them, instead of being accorded the hero's treatment

Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision,
said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the
driver's explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital frontliners.
Days before this, a mob ganged up on and threw bleach all over the face of a frontliner on his way to report for duty at a
hospital in Tacurong City in Sultan Kudarat, while a medical technologist in Cagayan de Oro claimed that some public vehicles
declined to let her board.
Also last week in Cebu, two nurses were barred from entering the condominium where they were staying after they
identified themselves as murses. It has become a common experience shared by many of their colleagues across the country; health
workers have found themselves evicted from eateries in Iloilo, turned away from their dormitories in Baguio, refused transport by
tricycles in Cabanatuan City and Quezon City, and so on.
Patients, too, are targeted. In a barangay in Tondo, a resident who tested positive was blocked from retuming to his rented
apartmcar. The health department's order was for him to self-quarantine at home since he was asymptomatic, but the barangay's
residents barricaded the street and refused to let the ambulance through, despite a Manila councilor coming over to try to resolve
the impasse. The patient, unable to return home to his parents who were elderly and thus at high-risk of contracting the disease,
was forced to find temporary shelter in a hospital.
Sometimes, all it takes is wild suspicion, and anyone can become an object of hostility and rejection. As GMA News
reported last Monday "A supermarket security guard lost both her rented apartment and her job after she went home one day and
seemed to have been running a fever." When a thermal scan showed her temperature to be above 36 degrees Celsius, she was told
to go the hospital first and have herself checked. The hospital determined she had no fever, but when she got back to her apartment,

Bernadette)Similar to other countries, the public health system in the Philippines was unprepared forand overburdened by COVID-19. The first case was reported on January 30 when a Chinese womanreached the country from Wuhan, China, and then a few days later her male companion died ofthe virus - making it the first recorded death outside of China (Department of Health (DOH), 2020b;Ramzy and May, 2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a). By March 7, the first case oflocal transmission was confirmed (DOH, 2020a; WHO, 2020a). To date, there are 112,593confirmed cases, 6,263 new cases, and 2,115 deaths in the country (WHO, 2020b) - making the Philippines as one of the most highly impacted in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific RegionEqually alarming is the number of doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who get infected and die of COVID-19 (CNN Philippines, 2020a; McCarthy, 2020). Recently, professional medical and allied medical associations have called for a unified and calibrated response and temporaryquarantine of the country's capital to avoid a total collapse of the healthcare system (Batnag, 2020).Critical but seldom discussed are the challenges of journalism in making sense of the rapid spread and devastating impact of COVID-19 in the Philippines and how the pandemic is also gradually transforming journalism in the country.Questions: 1.

                            17. PLEASE HELP ME TO ANSWER MY LEARNING TASK. THANKSWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Philippines in early March, people started looking for answers.In a country that has faced disease outbreaks, the sight of doctors and nurses aiding the sick is comforting to many. It came as a surprise when some people started to turn against frontline health workers shortly after the lockdown in mid-March.Reports of health workers being attacked became news, with many experiencing eviction, ridicule, and harassment. Despite public adulation for their heroic sacrifices, frontline health workers fear for their lives as the risk of stigmatization weighs almost as heavy as their exposure to the virus.It’s lonely in the front lineOne of the first to provide support as COVID-19 broke, UNICEF responded to requests from the Department of Health (DOH) and delivered tents to hospitals to help manage the triage and isolation of suspected cases and to increase the overall capacity for the response.At Sta. Ana Hospital in the capital Manila, one of the government-run hospitals that received a UNICEF tent, the medical staff say they’re fortunate because the management provides living quarters and meals.Being in the front line exposes them to immediate risks, so they’ve come to rely on each other.But when they find themselves alone at times, fear gets to them and hits the hardest during end of shift.“We face an internal struggle at the end of the day,” says Jose Karganilla, a 32-year-old nurse. “What if I get sick? I’m on my own.”His colleague and friend, Patrick Tan, 31, believes the pandemic makes some of them question why they do what they do. “Some of us struggle to accept that we’re risking our lives,” he says as he weighs his next words. “We’re working with one foot in the grave.”Sanita Uy-Vistal, a laboratory scientist, praises her colleagues in the front line. But she sometimes wishes they could get support, too.“People always see doctors and nurses. They don’t see the lab scientistbehind all this,” Sanita says. “We handle the specimen for testing which exposes us to a greater risk.”​</h2><br />

</p><p>3. How should this situation be addressed?
</p><p>- This situation must be addressed by the government through spreading awareness to everyone to stay at home because by saving our lives we are also keeping our medical workers safe. Our government must also give their 100% support in all aspects. </p><p>
</p><p>4. What Filipino values can be gained from the given text?
