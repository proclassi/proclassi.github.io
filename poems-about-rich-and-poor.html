FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis

the country – Juba, South Judan 
“The human race shall always overcome,” 
said Jommo Kenyatta 
See, I am the ultimate test 
How well do you work together? How 
well coordinated are you? 
Covid 19 is my name 
I know no boundaries or lanes 
No celebrity can match my fame 
Like a roaring flame I engulf all on my path 
The poor and the rich both feel my wrath 
You have a common enemy in me So, 
lower your guns and focus on mellower 
your rank, tribe, ethnicity and focus on me 
For can’t you see, can’t you see 
I know off no hierarchy 
My presence brings fear and anarchy 
I stronger than Samson 
For I break the unbreakable 
I’ll break your economy 
I’ll break your faith 
But that’s only if you let me 
For the racism you show only strengthens me 
You like hiding your identity, then wear a 
mask 
You claim that your hands are clean, then 
sanitize 
For the death I cause is no man’s fault but 
rather my nature 
You shall overcome me; it’s in your blood, it’s 
your nature 
I am no professor, neither is this a lecture 
As nations cower in fear 
For I grab many victims in a day For 
once they see something worse than war 
For once they see humanity is worth 
fighting for 
What goes up must come down 
No authority is higher than me 
For I break the laws of traditions 
I break the laws of a normal condition 
But I’ll never break the so-called men 
Bend them to their breaking points 
Once they kill me, they forget my wrath 
and once again I’ll strike 
As you suffer because of me Also try 
and learn from me and your 
mistakes 
As I go down the books of history 
Still there’s more to come 
Maintain the togetherness And 
there will be no harm 
Share the little you have 
Before I strike and leave you with none 
The only way to survive me, is by joining 
heads 
Lock your doors for I roam the streets 
Stay alert for like an assassin; you never 
know my target. 
But only working together can tame my

“The human race shall always overcome,” 
said Jommo Kenyatta 
See, I am the ultimate test 
How well do you work together? How 
well coordinated are you? 
Covid 19 is my name 
I know no boundaries or lanes 
No celebrity can match my fame 
Like a roaring flame I engulf all on my path 
The poor and the rich both feel my wrath 
You have a common enemy in me So, 
lower your guns and focus on mellower 
your rank, tribe, ethnicity and focus on me 
For can’t you see, can’t you see 
I know off no hierarchy 
My presence brings fear and anarchy 
I stronger than Samson 
For I break the unbreakable 
I’ll break your economy 
I’ll break your faith 
But that’s only if you let me 
For the racism you show only strengthens me 
You like hiding your identity, then wear a 
mask 
You claim that your hands are clean, then 
sanitize 
For the death I cause is no man’s fault but 
rather my nature 
You shall overcome me; it’s in your blood, it’s 
your nature 
I am no professor, neither is this a lecture 
As nations cower in fear 
For I grab many victims in a day For 
once they see something worse than war 
For once they see humanity is worth 
fighting for 
What goes up must come down 
No authority is higher than me 
For I break the laws of traditions 
I break the laws of a normal condition 
But I’ll never break the so-called men 
Bend them to their breaking points 
Once they kill me, they forget my wrath 
and once again I’ll strike 
As you suffer because of me Also try 
and learn from me and your 
mistakes 
As I go down the books of history 
Still there’s more to come 
Maintain the togetherness And 
there will be no harm 
Share the little you have 
Before I strike and leave you with none 
The only way to survive me, is by joining 
heads 
Lock your doors for I roam the streets 
Stay alert for like an assassin; you never 
know my target. 
But only working together can tame my
