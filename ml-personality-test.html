It requires an athlete to continuous the 20m shuttle runs. The athlete needs to reach the end of the 20m grid before the beep sounds. The time between the beep sound decreases every minute, therefore, the athlete must increase his/her speed.<br /><br />This test measures the aerobic power of an individual in a sport such as Soccer, Football, Rugby, Hockey and others. <br /><br />To Calculate <br /><strong>VO^2</strong><br />VO ^2 max = - age + speed <br /><br />Speed is the final 20m shuttle run before the test withdrawal.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Total Distance</strong><br /> It is measured by recording the total number of shuttles of an athlete multiply by 20.<br /><br /><strong>Level Achieved</strong><br />It is the athlete level reach.
